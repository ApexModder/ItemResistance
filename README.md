# [ItemResistance](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/itemresistance)

This mod prevents blocks dropped on the floor from being blown up by explosions.<br>
This happens by checking the dropped item block's resistance against the explosion strength, similar to how in world blocks resist explosions.
